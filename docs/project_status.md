## Milestone 15 — Practicum video + remote certification, admin view-switch, auth fix ✅ Complete

Filmed and shipped the Train to Be Sharp Level 1 practicum as a single chaptered video, rebuilt the Practicum module around it (one lesson per chapter), and built the full **remote-certification loop** — students submit a technique video, Erik reviews it, and the certificate is gated on approval — as its own course section. Plus an admin/user view switcher and an auth bounce-to-login fix.

- [x] **Admin ↔ User view switching** — the dashboard user modal shows an "Admin" link for admin emails; the admin sidebar gets a "User Dashboard" link back (`fbab0cb`)
- [x] **Auth bounce-to-login fix** — Next prefetch of admin links hit `proxy.ts` (the renamed middleware) and rotated the Supabase refresh token on requests whose `Set-Cookie` the browser drops, logging admins out mid-session. Fixed by excluding prefetch from the proxy matcher, carrying refreshed cookies onto the login redirect, and `prefetch={false}` on admin/switch links (`f3ca412`)
- [x] **Practicum video** — produced the 44-min Level 1 practicum (ProRes master → 1080p H.264 + HLS adaptive set), transcribed locally with `whisper.cpp`, and authored **20 chapters**; uploaded to YouTube unlisted (`_Aam40x1HDw`) with description timestamps
- [x] **Clickable chapters** — new `components/courses/video-with-chapters.tsx` (YouTube IFrame API) embeds the player and a clickable chapter list that seeks it (active chapter highlights); rendered for any video lesson with a YouTube `video_url`
- [x] **Practicum module = one lesson per chapter (20)** — replaced the 10 theory-plan stubs with the 20 actual chapters, each deep-linked to its timestamp (`?t=`). No student progress existed (`a145080`, `7b0abdb`)
- [x] **Lesson double-title fix** — lessons rendered their title twice (page `<h1>` + leading `## <title>` in content); `LessonContent` now strips the leading heading when it matches the title (`8e2fcaa`)
- [x] **Remote certification (issue [#23](https://github.com/elagerway/covecutlery/issues/23), Phases 1–5)** — **link-only** (YouTube/Vimeo; no stored files): `practicum_submissions` table + RLS, student submission UI + `api/courses/practicum-submission`, admin review queue (`PracticumSubmissions` + `api/admin/training/submissions`) on the Training page and per student, **certificate gating** (issuance blocked until an approved submission, only for courses with a practicum module), and Postmark notifications both ways via `src/lib/notify.ts` (`81f9b5f`, `a0ac2e7`, `50bc668`, `d379e3c`, `8bf943d`)
- [x] **Remote Certification as its own section** — moved out of the practicum module into a dedicated "Remote Certification" module (order 10) with remote-student process clarification, a gold-emphasized header/row, and a medal icon; completion (green-check) workflow preserved (`c9afa32`, `8933b24`, `16b2378`, `3613b04`)
- [x] **Migrations** `20260627000000` (practicum_submissions + bucket) and `20260627010000` (drop bucket/`storage_path` → link-only); applied to prod via the Supabase Management API
- [x] **Vercel** — a transient deploy-outputs error on `16b2378` (the build had completed) self-healed on the next commit; documented the correct log-reading command (CLI `--scope=snapsonic`)
- [x] Memories: updated `courses-payment-lms`, new `vercel-build-logs`
- [x] Shipped as commits `fbab0cb` → `3613b04` on `main`

## Milestone 14 — Schedule TZ fix, fresh reviews, course payment enforcement, practicum ✅ Complete

A round of fixes and the start of the practicum: fixed a date bug in the schedule widget, refreshed Google reviews, closed a free-access hole so courses actually require payment, and stood up the Train to Be Sharp practicum (video) curriculum as GitHub issues + LMS stubs.

- [x] **Schedule off-by-one** — `addDays()` built a `Date` at the host's local (UTC) midnight then re-read it as Vancouver, shifting day 0 back a day. Switched to pure UTC calendar arithmetic; label helpers also UTC-safe (`bce9d4b`)
- [x] **Course prices** — `/courses` + `/courses/[slug]` showed a hardcoded "Free" badge; now driven by `is_free`/`price` ($600 shows correctly) (`ee2b46c`)
- [x] **Payment enforced for LMS access** — lesson page no longer auto-enrolls any logged-in visitor (it redirects to the overview); `api/courses/enroll` maps routing slug → LMS slug (`one-inch-grinder` → `train-to-be-sharp`) so paying actually grants access; non-enrolled overview shows an "Enroll — $price" CTA; deleted unused free-insert `enroll-button.tsx` (`70d05fa`, `8b7b427`). Access now comes only from a paid enrollment or an invite
- [x] **Reviews refreshed** — 5 newest 5★ Google reviews pulled via Places Details API and prepended in `ReviewsSection.tsx` (5.0 across 48 ratings) (`e08e518`)
- [x] **Practicum curriculum** — GitHub epic [#1](https://github.com/elagerway/covecutlery/issues/1) + 10 sub-issues #13–#22 (one video lesson per theory module, each with script + shot list)
- [x] **Practicum LMS stubs** — `seed_train_to_be_sharp_practicum.sql` adds a "Practicum: Watch Erik Sharpen" module (order 9) with 10 video-lesson stubs; applied to prod (`fb53fa5`)
- [x] Memories: refreshed `reviews-ingestion`, new `courses-payment-lms`, new `supabase-prod-db-access`
- [x] Shipped as commits `bce9d4b` → `fb53fa5` on `main`

## Milestone 13 — Cal booking sync, jobs admin, voice picker + cloning ✅ Complete

Closed a hole where native Cal.com bookings never reached `/admin/jobs`, made jobs manageable (delete + cleaner table), and added live voice selection + cloning for the phone agent. Capped off with a code-review pass and fixes.

- [x] **Cal webhook** `POST /api/webhooks/cal` syncs native-page bookings into the `bookings` table (`BOOKING_CREATED`/`CANCELLED`/`RESCHEDULED`), keyed on `cal_booking_uid`; **HMAC signature verification** (`CAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) verified live
- [x] **Unique index** on `cal_booking_uid` + `/api/cal/book` switched to an error-checked upsert; **backfilled 4 missing real jobs** (Pascal, Chris, Mike, Daniel)
- [x] **Delete a job** in `/admin/jobs` (row trash + drawer button, confirm modal) → cancels the Cal appointment (active + upcoming only) and removes the row; blocks on unrefunded deposit
- [x] **Jobs table formatting** — right-aligned tabular money, muted `$0`, uniform rows; **all admin views capped at 1400px left-aligned** via the shared layout
- [x] **Voice picker** (`/admin/voice-prompt`) sets the live Magpipe agent's voice; **voice cloning** via in-browser recording or file upload (`/api/admin/voice/clone` → Magpipe → ElevenLabs)
- [x] **Shared helpers** `src/lib/cal.ts` + voice helpers in `src/lib/magpipe.ts`; deduped 3× Cal-cancel copies; booking routes use shared `requireAdmin`
- [x] **Stripe-checkout** insert→upsert so a webhook race can't destroy a paying booking
- [x] **Code-review fixes** — out-of-order webhook guard, reschedule row-move, VoiceCloner mic/URL/timer fixes, delete-failure modal UX
- [x] Removed 5 test/owner rows; `/admin/jobs` shows 6 real jobs
- [x] Memories updated: `booking_ingestion_sync` (+ signature verification), new `magpipe_voice_agent`, refined `magpipe_integration` (HTTP works with the key for these endpoints)
- [x] Shipped as commits `1db2373` → `137d297` on `main`

## Milestone 12 — Supabase cross-org migration + auth overhaul ✅ Complete

Moved the production Supabase project to a new org under a separate billing account and rebuilt the auth flow around real passwords + Google OAuth.

- [x] **Migrated** Cove Blades Supabase from old project `kvatxuhjiinjpvsyably` (Cove Cutlery org, free tier) to new `dbrphymgtnkkythvunyf` (snapsonic org, Pro). 17 MB of data total. Triggered by a compute-exhaustion outage on the Nano free tier
- [x] **Migrator** `scripts/migrate-supabase.py` — Management API + PostgREST only, no `pg_dump`/`psql` required; handles FK dependency order, sequence resets, generated-column exclusion, and post-`drop schema` grant restoration
- [x] **Row-count verification** across all 26 public tables + `auth.users` + `auth.identities` — every count matched at cutover; no writes leaked to OLD between snapshot and Vercel env-var swap
- [x] **Vercel prod env swap** + redeploy + smoke test on `/api/events` confirming writes land on new project
- [x] **Old project paused** for rollback insurance (decision: pause now, delete in ~1 week)
- [x] **Killed the magic link.** Replaced `/admin/login` magic-link form with a server-side redirect to `/auth/login?redirect=/admin`; deleted `/api/auth/magic-link`. All admin sign-in flows through the shared `/auth/login` (email+password or Google), admin status from `ADMIN_EMAILS.includes(user.email)`
- [x] **Password reset flow** — `/auth/forgot-password` + `/auth/reset-password` + `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` (Postmark + `generateLink(type=recovery)`); "Forgot password?" link on `/auth/login`
- [x] **`/auth/confirm` intermediate page** that defeats Gmail's link-scanner pre-fetch. Token only consumed when user clicks the button, not when scanners HEAD/GET the URL. Applied to recovery, magic-link-style, and signup confirmation emails
- [x] **Google OAuth** re-configured on new project — plaintext secret pasted from Google Cloud Console (per-project encryption means it can't be copied via Management API); new redirect URI added in Google Console
- [x] **Sign In** promoted to gold-outlined button on home page Navbar (was easy-to-miss muted gray text)
- [x] **Contact page** got a Text contact option alongside Call (same number, `sms:` href)
- [x] Memories updated: `email_scanner_prefetch` (with the `/auth/confirm` fix), `supabase_mcp_wrong_project` (new project ref), new `supabase_cross_org_migration`
- [x] Shipped as commits `6eeff0d` → `216612e` on `main`

## Milestone 11 — Training course pages, online content, and Stripe enrollment ✅ Complete

Four training modules with detail pages, sign-up + payment (Stripe/e-transfer), full online course content (LMS), and admin enrollment toggles.

- [x] `/train-to-be-sharp/one-inch-grinder` — detailed course page with structure, copy from owner, $600 sign-up form

- [x] `/train-to-be-sharp/build-your-business` — hands-on build session: 6 deliverables, tech stack (Claude Code/Next.js/Vercel/Supabase/GitHub), 4-step session flow
- [x] Training hub cards all clickable with "Learn more" links and hover effects
- [x] `CourseSignUp` component — name/email/phone + Turnstile, Stripe Checkout or Interac e-Transfer toggle
- [x] `course_enrollments` table + `/api/courses/enroll` endpoint handling both payment paths
- [x] Stripe webhook marks enrollment paid + auto-enrolls in LMS (if account exists)
- [x] Auth callback auto-enrolls on signup/login if email matches a paid enrollment
- [x] Success pages with "Create Account & Start Learning" CTA
- [x] 3 online courses seeded: Two-Inch Grinder (24 lessons), Business Process (18 lessons), Build Your Business (22 lessons) — 64 lessons + 17 quizzes total
- [x] `enrollment_open` column on courses table + admin toggle in `/admin/training`
- [x] One-Inch Grinder enrollment enabled; other three disabled pending content review
- [x] Shipped as commits `c57925b` → `b1646a5` on `main`

## Milestone 10 — Admin inbox (SMS + Email) ✅ Complete

Unified two-channel inbox in `/admin` with read state, search, badge counts, and three auto-replies.

- [x] `/admin/messages` — SMS via Magpipe (`list-messages` + `send-user-sms`). Chat-bubble UI, ⌘↵ send, 10s polling. Outbound gold right, inbound dark left, AI auto-replies tagged.
- [x] Spans both Cove Blades service numbers (current `+16042108180` + retired `+16043731500`) via `SERVICE_NUMBERS` array
- [x] Conversation filters: drop service-to-service self-loops, drop one-way outbound blasts
- [x] `/admin/email` — Postmark Inbound → SiteGround forwarders for `info@` / `erik@` / `training@coveblades.com` → webhook → `emails` table. Conversation-list + thread-view + composer preserving `In-Reply-To` / `References`.
- [x] `training@coveblades.com` provisioned (new mailbox)
- [x] Three auto-reply templates dispatched by `autoReplyFor(mailbox)`: `info@` (self-serve links), `erik@` (brief personal), `training@` (Train-to-Be-Sharp pitch)
- [x] Loop protection (skips `@coveblades.com` senders + `noreply|mailer-daemon|postmaster|bounce`)
- [x] Read state: `sms_message_reads` table for SMS + reuses `emails.status` for email
- [x] Per-conversation unread badge + sidebar badge counts on `Messages` and `Email` (polls `/api/admin/unread-counts` every 30s, shows on desktop sidebar and mobile bottom bar)
- [x] Search on both inboxes (debounced 250ms, server-side filter on body/subject/sender/recipient)
- [x] Setup doc: `docs/marketing/postmark-inbound-setup.md`
- [x] Historical SignalWire backfill scaffolding (`historical_sms_messages` + `scripts/backfill-signalwire.mjs`) — not currently needed because Magpipe has all history, kept as fallback

## Milestone 9.6 — Booking-flow rescue + analytics canary ✅ Complete

Restored a 16-day Cal.com booking outage and built the monitoring that prevents recurrence.

- [x] `attendeeDefined` location-type fix restored on `/api/cal/book` (was reverted by an LMS commit committed from a stale working tree)
- [x] `npm run smoke:booking` script — posts live test booking + cancels, asserts 2xx
- [x] `.env.local` `CAL_EVENT_TYPE_ID` corrected to prod `2520929`
- [x] Self-hosted analytics: `analytics_events` table + `/api/events` beacon + `<AnalyticsTracker />` in root layout
- [x] `/admin/analytics` — KPI cards, 30-day pageview chart, **booking funnel with per-step conversion** (canary for any future booking outage), recent booking failures, top pages / CTAs / referrers / city pages
- [x] Memories: `cal-booking-location-type`, `feedback-review-diff-before-commit`

## Milestone 9.7 — Lower Mainland SEO expansion (+10 cities) ✅ Complete

Extended Milestone 5 with 10 more full city landing pages (15 total).

- [x] Added: Richmond, Surrey, Delta, New Westminster, Langley, Maple Ridge, Pitt Meadows, White Rock, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody

- [x] Refactored existing Coquitlam entry from "Tri-Cities" bundle → Coquitlam-only (avoids self-competition with new Port Moody / Port Coquitlam pages)
- [x] Internal linking: prose mentions in `about` / `contact` link to specific city pages; service-area table cells link; homepage `MobileServiceSection` cards link; `HeroSection` trust strip + `TrustBar` + `ServicesSection` regional labels link to the `/service-area` hub
- [x] `sitemap.ts` picks up all 15 routes automatically (no code change)

## Milestone 9.8 — Google Ads conversion infrastructure ✅ Code complete, awaiting GAds config

Conversion tracking is wired and the launch playbook is paste-ready; campaign creation is pending.

- [x] `gtag.js` (AW-18180527373) installed in root layout
- [x] `fireBookingConversion()` fires on every `booking_succeeded` — no-op until `NEXT_PUBLIC_GADS_CONVERSION_ID` is populated
- [x] `docs/marketing/google-ads-launch.md` — 6-step playbook with paste-ready content for 5 ad groups (Mobile, Vancouver, North Shore, Japanese, Restaurants), negative keywords, geographic targeting, bidding strategy, 30-day monitoring checklist
- [ ] **Owner action**: create conversion action in Google Ads UI → copy `AW-XXXX/label` → set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GADS_CONVERSION_ID` in `.env.local` + Vercel
- [ ] **Owner action**: create the campaign by pasting from playbook (~30 min)

## Milestone 4 — Brand rebrand: Cove Cutlery → Cove Blades ✅ Complete

Site fully rebranded and live at the new domain.

- [x] Brand sweep across UI, metadata, JSON-LD, OpenGraph, manifest, llms.txt, project_spec, active docs (~200 string replacements across 41 files)
- [x] Production domain switched: `covecutlery.ca` → `coveblades.com`

---

## Milestone 9 — Invite-only courses, Postmark email unification, voice agent integration ✅ Complete

Lock down the course platform so only invited people can sign up; standardize all transactional email on Postmark with branded templates; wire up the Magpipe voice agent (with a no-phone-booking rule) and capture call data via webhook.

- [x] `course_invites` table with token-based invitation flow; admin sends invites from `/admin/training`
- [x] Signup gated by invite token (read-only email, course preview, existing-user redirect)
- [x] Auto-enroll on email confirmation + invite row deleted in same transaction (no "accepted" state, no cleanup cron)
- [x] Self-enrollment RLS policy dropped — only the invite-callback flow can create `user_enrollments` rows
- [x] Customer autocomplete on the invite email field
- [x] Cancel pending invites from admin UI + DELETE endpoint
- [x] `POST /api/auth/signup` and `POST /api/auth/magic-link` — branded Postmark emails for new-user confirmation and admin magic link (replaces Supabase's built-in mailer)
- [x] `src/lib/brand.ts` — central brand constants (phone, email, colors, logo URL)
- [x] Voice agent system prompt stored in `app_credentials`, edited at `/admin/voice-prompt`
- [x] Magpipe MCP server registered (`magpipe-mcp-server` v0.2.1) — direct curl rejects `mgp_` keys; only the MCP works for SMS
- [x] Magpipe post-call webhook at `/api/webhooks/magpipe/post-call` — plain unauthenticated POST, writes to `magpipe_call_logs`
- [x] Training page rejig — clickable rows open per-student detail with suspend/unsuspend (Supabase user-ban API) + scoped wrong-answers
- [x] Phone number swept site-wide: `604-373-1500` → `+1 (604) 210-8180` (display) and `+16043731500` → `+16042108180` (E.164 + `tel:`); `MAGPIPE_SMS_FROM` rotated on Vercel
- [x] "Call to book" copy removed from FAQs and service-area pages — booking is online-only
- [x] `llms.txt` ## Booking section telling AI agents to direct to website
- [x] Admin email allowlist consolidated to `ADMIN_EMAILS` array in `src/lib/admin.ts` (was inconsistent across layout/proxy/lib)
- [x] Customer search no longer crashes on null email (partial unique index leftover)
- [x] Customer create with email now works (replaced upsert/onConflict with explicit check-then-insert/update — the partial unique index can't be used by ON CONFLICT)
- [x] Auth callback redirect uses `http://` for localhost (was forcing `https://` for all matched forwarded hosts)
- [x] Production live at commit `5d8845a` aliased to `coveblades.com`

### Milestone 9.1 — Invite-flow safety net + Sign in nav link (2026-05-08)
- [x] Course-page self-heal — auto-enrolls a logged-in user who has a matching pending invite, so the flow survives a dropped `invite=` param or a `getUser()`-returns-null callback edge case
- [x] `/api/admin/training/activate` + Activate button — manual enrollment override for customers who signed up but didn't auto-enroll
- [x] "Sign in" link in the public Navbar (was missing — logged-out students had no entry point back into their courses)
- [x] Unblocked `jamesmarkalexander@hotmail.com` manually (auth user + enrollment intact; invite deleted)
- [x] All three paths verified end-to-end on production via Playwright (self-heal, Activate, 409-no-account)

### Milestone 9.2 — Removed service-area gating on mobile booking (2026-05-13)
- [x] James reported "Please select your address from the autocomplete suggestions…" trying to book mobile sharpening on his phone — `addressCoords` precheck failed because mobile autofill / fast typers / keyboard-dismissed dropdowns never populate it
- [x] Owner unblocked James manually (booked outside the form) before the fix shipped
- [x] Removed all service-area gating client- and server-side: `addressCoords` state + precheck + haversine in `BookingModal.tsx`; `geocodeAddress` + 422 service-area block in `/api/cal/book`; `HOME_BASE`/`MAX_KM`/`MAX_LNG` constants from both
- [x] Terms of Service §6 and Privacy Policy §3 updated to remove now-false "we verify service area eligibility" language
- [x] Dropped unused `geometry` field from `/api/geocode` place-details fetch (Places API cost reduction)
- [x] Verified end-to-end on iPhone-emulated viewport (Toronto address, no autocomplete tap → "You're booked!")
- [x] Shipped as commit `0a1e51c` on `main`
- [ ] Known follow-up: `/api/cal/book` is now slightly more open to garbage submissions; revisit if abuse appears

### Milestone 9.3 — Training certificates (2026-05-14)
- [x] Admin can issue a "Certificate of Achievement" PDF to any enrolled student from `/admin/training` → student detail → Certificates panel; the cert is delivered by email + available on the student's `/dashboard/certificates` page + downloadable by the admin
- [x] `certificates` table + private `certificates` Storage bucket (migration `20260514000000_create_certificates.sql`); RLS lets a user read only their own rows
- [x] `pdf-lib` overlay renderer composites recipient name + issued date + verify-URL footer onto the existing `public/certificate-template.pdf` (842 × 595 PDF points, coordinates measured pixel-accurately from the template — name centered on the upper underline at x=502, date on the "Level 1 Training on" blank at x=556, verify URL on the cert's visual axis at x=502)
- [x] Short verification code generator (`CB-XXXX-XXXX`, Crockford-ish base32 minus visually ambiguous chars)
- [x] Public verify page at `/certificates/<short_code>` — shows verified / revoked / 404
- [x] API: POST/GET issue+list, POST email (re-send), POST revoke, GET signed-URL download (owner-or-admin auth)
- [x] Preview button in the issue form — admin sees the rendered PDF in a new tab without writing to the DB or sending email; preview footer reads "PREVIEW — Not a valid certificate" instead of a fake verify URL
- [x] Postmark email matches the existing invite/invoice template style (gold "View Verification Page" CTA, PDF attachment)
- [x] Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-training-certificates-design.md`, plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-14-training-certificates.md`
- [x] Shipped as commits `c102f4a` → `dcdf625` on `main`

### Milestone 9.4 — Training landing course-split (2026-05-14)
- [x] `/train-to-be-sharp` modules grid expanded from 3 → 4 cards: existing "Business Process & Automation" repositioned as the introductory tier ($200, "Two-hour session · Introduction"); new "Build Your Business with AI — Hands-On" added ($600, "Half-day workshop", Sparkles icon)
- [x] Page metadata description and "Three Modules" / "Four Modules" heading both updated for consistency
- [x] Grid layout changed to `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4` for responsive 2×2 / 4-up
- [x] Marketing copy only — no DB changes (the new course is a landing-page card, not an enrolled-course row)
- [x] Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-training-landing-course-split-design.md`
- [x] Shipped as commits `3d198d5` and `59ad5d8` on `main`

---

## Milestone 8 — Auto-rotating Instagram token ✅ Complete

Set-and-forget rotation of the Instagram Graph API long-lived token. No more manual refresh ceremony every 60 days.

- [x] `app_credentials` Supabase table (service-role-only RLS) for runtime-mutable secrets
- [x] `lib/credentials.ts` — `getCredential` / `setCredential` helpers
- [x] `lib/instagram.ts` reads token from Supabase first, falls back to env
- [x] `/api/cron/refresh-instagram-token` — `CRON_SECRET`-gated, refreshes when expiry < 14 days away
- [x] `vercel.json` cron schedule: `0 9 * * 1` (every Monday 09:00 UTC)
